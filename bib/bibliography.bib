	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles are being used in several monitoring applications to collect data from a set of targets. These vehicles are heterogeneous in the sense that they can differ either in their motion constraints or sensing capabilities. Furthermore, not all vehicles may be able to visit a given target because vehicles may occasionally be equipped with disparate sensors due to the respective payload restrictions. This article addresses a problem where a group of heterogeneous vehicles located at distinct depots visit a set of targets. The targets are partitioned into disjoint subsets: targets to be visited by specific vehicles and targets that any of the vehicles can visit. The objective is to find an optimal tour for each vehicle starting at its respective depot such that each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, the vehicle-target constraints are satisfied and the sum of the costs of the tours for all the vehicles is minimized. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to compute an optimal solution to the problem. Computational results show that optimal solutions for problems involving 100 targets and 5 vehicles can be obtained within 300 seconds on average, further corroborating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a unified exact method for solving an extended model of the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem ({CVRP}), called the Heterogenous Vehicle Routing Problem ({HVRP}), where a mixed fleet of vehicles having different capacities, routing and fixed costs is used to supply a set of customers. The {HVRP} model considered in this paper contains as special cases: the Single Depot {CVRP}, all variants of the {HVRP} presented in the literature, the Site-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem ({SDVRP}) and the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem ({MDVRP}). This paper presents an exact algorithm for the {HVRP} based on the set partitioning formulation. The exact algorithm uses three types of bounding procedures based on the {LP}-relaxation and on the Lagrangean relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of {HVRPs}, {SDVRP} and {MDVRP} show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered.},

	abstract = {Consider a setting where robots must visit sites represented as nodes in a graph, but each robot may fail when traversing an edge. The goal is to find a set of paths for a team of robots which maximizes the expected number of nodes collectively visited, while guaranteeing that the paths satisfy a notion of “independence” formalized by a matroid (e.g. limits on team size, number of visits to regions), and that the probabilities that each robot survives to its destination are above a given threshold. We call this problem the Matroid Team Surviving Orienteers ({MTSO}) problem, which has broad applications such as environmental monitoring in risky regions and search and rescue in dangerous conditions. We present the {MTSO} formally and detail numerous examples of matroids in a path planning context. We then propose an approximate greedy algorithm for selecting a feasible set of paths and prove that the value of the output is within a factor ps/ps + λ of the optimum, where ps is the per-robot survival probability threshold and 1/λ ≤ 1 is the approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well known orienteering problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying it to a scenario where a team of robots must gather information while avoiding pirates in the Coral Triangle.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the {VRP} literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines {VRP}’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the {VRP} literature, and delineates all of {VRP}’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published {VRP} taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the {VRP} literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the {VRP} literature.},

The temporal constraints allow for imposing pairwise synchronization and pairwise temporal precedence between customer visits, independently of the vehicles. We describe some real world problems where in the literature the temporal constraints are usually remarkably simplified in the solution process, even though these constraints may significantly improve the solution quality and/or usefulness. We also propose an optimization based heuristic to solve real size instances. The results of numerical experiments substantiate the importance of the temporal constraints in the solution approach. We also make a computational study by comparing a direct use of a commercial solver against the proposed heuristic, where the latter approach can find high quality solutions within specific time limits.},

In order to obtain a valid planning, some skill, time window, and synchronization constraints must be met. Since the increase in demand, organizations providing home health care are eager to optimize the planning of caregivers which is often performed manually. Thus, many works have emerged on this research problem, taking into account new constraints gradually. One interesting aspect is the workload balancing between caregivers. Indeed, the workload must be roughly the same to obtain fairness. Already applied successfully to similar problems, the ant colony optimization algorithm has never been applied to the home health care problem. As a result, an original hybrid algorithm combining memetic and ant colony optimization algorithm is suggested for solving the home health care problem with working time balancing. Computational results on benchmark instances from the literature highlight the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm in comparison with other metaheuristics and a commercial optimization solver.},

Two objectives are considered: the first one is to minimize the total operation cost of the healthcare agency and the second one is to maximize the patient satisfaction. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer program, to seek for a trade-off between two objectives, with the characteristics of the patient requirements including nursing types, nursing frequency and service length considered. Medical team types, available service days and overwork penalty are also respected in the model. Then an \$\${\textbackslash}epsilon \$\$ϵ-constraint method is adopted to obtain exact non-dominated solutions. To address large-scale problem instances, three heuristic approaches are developed to generate approximate Pareto fronts in a reasonable time. The set of non-dominated solutions are valuable for decision-making. Computational experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the approaches.},

These services allow patients to remain in their own homes, thereby reducing governmental costs by decentralizing the care. In this work, we present a set partitioning heuristic which takes into account most of the industry’s practical constraints. The developed method is based on a set partitioning formulation and a large neighborhood search ({LNS}) framework. The algorithm solves a linear relaxation of a set partitioning model using the columns generated by the large neighborhood search. A constructive heuristic is then called to build an integer solution. This project is joint work with Alayacare, a start-up sited in Montral (Canada) developing an operations management platform for home health care agencies. They provide their clients with a flexible optimization module that solves real-life instances in no more than 10 minutes. Based on their real instances, the proposed method is able to provide a reduction in travel time by 37\% and an increase by more than 16\% in continuity of care. We also provide a public benchmark for this problem.},

	abstract = {Efficient use of resources while ensuring quality services points the attention of Home Health Care structures ({HHC}). {HHC} structures propose keeping at home patients who do not necessarily need full hospitalization, and enabling people who suffered serious illnesses to follow the care from their own home. Habitually, asked services have to be performed at specific times, and may require the intervention of several qualified caregivers related by precedence constraints. These structures have the concern to reduce product consumption costs, limit losses and provide high quality services. Their main budgetary item is defined by the personal salary, which is incompressible. So, costs should be reduced on other posts. In this context, personal travel cost has a major importance in the spending of the institutions, which seems necessary to optimize. Moreover, patient satisfaction is also a significant criterion in improving the service quality of such structures. Therefore, developing an effective caregivers planning require the use of optimization methods and decision tools. In this article, this issue is modeled as a particular variant of vehicle routing problem with time windows and timing constraints, where some patients ask for more than one visit simultaneously or in a given priority order, called as the {VRPTW}-{SP}. Timing constraints handled in this paper make the problem realistic that are more difficult to solve than {VRPTW}. The {VRPTW}-{SP} is a challenging and novel optimization problem, whose objective is the minimization of the caregivers travel cost added to the non preferences toward caregivers. To solve this problem, a Mixed Integer Linear Program, a greedy heuristic, two local search strategies and three metaheuristics are proposed, one being a hybridization of the two others. Experiments are conducted on new instances derived from the literature. As the metaheuristics share the same components the positive contribution of the hybridization is proved on the {VRPTW}-{SP} by statistical tests.},

The problem is a generalisation of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Required travel time between visits and time windows of the visits must be respected. The challenge when assigning visits to home carers lies in the existence of soft preference constraints and in temporal dependencies between the start times of visits. We model the problem as a set partitioning problem with side constraints and develop an exact branch-and-price solution algorithm, as this method has previously given solid results for classical vehicle routing problems. Temporal dependencies are modelled as generalised precedence constraints and enforced through the branching. We introduce a novel visit clustering approach based on the soft preference constraints. The algorithm is tested both on real-life problem instances and on generated test instances inspired by realistic settings. The use of the specialised branching scheme on real-life problems is novel. The visit clustering decreases run times significantly, and only gives a loss of quality for few instances. Furthermore, the visit clustering allows us to find solutions to larger problem instances, which cannot be solved to optimality.},

In this paper, we propose an indirect local search method using the product set of team-wise permutations as an auxiliary search space. It is shown that our method successfully avoids the interdependence problem induced by the precedence and synchronization constraints, and that it has the big advantage of non-deteriorating perturbations being available for iterated local search.},

	abstract = {Special vehicles named flat transporters are used to deliver heavy ship assembly blocks in shipyards. Because each movement of assembly blocks among workshops needs transporters and the transportations are time-consuming, the scheduling of transporters is important for maintaining the overall production schedule of assembly blocks. This paper considers an optimization transporter scheduling problem for assembly blocks. The objective is to minimize logistics time, which includes empty travel time of transporters and waiting time and delay time of block tasks. Considering time windows of ship blocks, carrying capacity of transporters, and precedence relationships of tasks, a mathematical model is proposed. A hybrid topological graph is used to denote precedence and cooperating relationships of tasks. A metaheuristic algorithm based on the hybrid topological graph and genetic algorithm and Tabu search is proposed. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing the algorithm to optimal result in small-sized instances and several strategies in large-sized instances. The results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A special focus is given to the temporal feasibility evaluation of an insertion which has been
proposed for the {PDPT} [5] and extended to the other problems. The concept of forward time slack
[6] is extended to provide a constant time feasibility test of temporal constraints. Experiments
confirm the solving time reduction provided by the implementation of this test in a meta-heuristic.},

The synchronization constraints in this problem interconnect various vehicles’ routes, making the problem more challenging than standard vehicle routing problem with time windows, especially in designing neighborhood search-based methods.

Accordingly, determining the best itinerary for visiting patients can be considered as a vehicle routing problem. In this paper, we investigate the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem for Home Health care (D-{HHC}). The D-{HHC} aims to determine the minimum cost route that allows the medical staff to provide medical services to a set of dispersed patients via a fleet of caregivers starting from a starting point (the hospital), while considering real-time requests. This means that new calls from patients could arrive after the departure of the caregiver and its route have to be readapted to include these new patients. To deal with the problem, a Hypermutation Genetic Algorithm ({HGA}) is proposed. The performance of the {HGA} is evaluated based on Solomon benchmarks.

In this model, both economic factors and qualitative service-oriented performance measures are simultaneously optimized. To make the model more realistic, many real situations such as considering different qualifications and diverse vehicles for staff members, different requirements and predetermined preferences for patients, possible temporal interdependencies between services, and continuity of care ({CoC}) are taken into account. We also added some important constraints related to blood sampling requirements, which make our proposed model more complex. The proposed model is a mixed integer linear programming model ({MILP}) that belongs to an {NP}-hard class of optimization problems. To solve such a complex mathematical model, a genetic algorithm ({GA}) is proposed to find near-optimal solutions. We use some randomly generated test instances with different sizes to evaluate the performance of the {GA}. Finally, it is demonstrated how the proposed solution scheme can end up with proper scheduling and routing policies compared to those obtained through exact methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model for the daily planning of health care services carried out at patients’ homes by staff members of a home care company. The planning takes into account individual service requirements of the patients, individual qualifications of the staff and possible interdependencies between different service operations. Interdependencies of services can include, for example, a temporal separation of two services as is required if drugs have to be administered a certain time before providing a meal. Other services like handling a disabled patient may require two staff members working together at a patient’s home. The time preferences of patients are included in terms of given time windows. In this paper, we propose a planning approach for the described problem, which can be used for optimizing economical and service oriented measures of performance. A mathematical model formulation is proposed together with a powerful heuristic based on a sophisticated solution representation.},

In this problem, customers request services from a company. Each service is composed of dependent tasks, which are executed by teams of varying skills along one or more days. Tasks belonging to a service may be executed by different teams, and customers may be visited more than once a day, as long as precedences are not violated. The objective is to schedule and route teams so that the makespan is minimized, i.e., all services are completed in the minimum number of days. In order to solve this problem, we propose a Mixed-Integer Programming model, a constructive algorithm and heuristic algorithms based on the Ant Colony Optimization ({ACO}) metaheuristic. The presence of precedence constraints makes it difficult to develop efficient local search algorithms. This motivates the choice of the {ACO} metaheuristic, which is effective in guiding the construction process towards good solutions. Computational results show that the model is capable of consistently solving problems with up to about 20 customers and 60 tasks. In most cases, the best performing {ACO} algorithm was able to match the best solution provided by the model in a fraction of its computational time.},

The subject of the contest, proposed by the telecommunications company France Télé com, consists in planning maintenance interventions and teams of technicians needed for their achievements. The addressed combinatorial optimization problem is very hard: it contains several {NP}-hard subproblems and its scale (hundreds of interventions and technicians) induces a huge combinatorics. An effective and efficient local-search heuristic is described to solve this problem. This algorithm was ranked 2nd of the competition (over the 35 teams who have submitted a solution). Moreover, a methodology is revealed to design and engineer high-performance local-search heuristics for solving practically discrete optimization problems.},

Here, the requirements are merely the presence of a set of technicians that possess the necessary capabilities. An additional complication is that a set of combined technicians stays together for the duration of a work day. This typically applies to scheduling of maintenance and installation operations. We build schedules by repeated application of a flexible matching model that selects tasks to be processed and forms groups of technicians assigned to combinations of tasks. The underlying mixed integer programming ({MIP}) model is capable of revising technician-task allocations and performs very well, especially in the case of rare skills.},

In combinatorial optimization, the exact methods are mostly used when the number of the customers in particular problems is relatively low and thus the optimal solution can be found in a reasonable time. The major exact techniques able to find optimal solutions are Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming. This is because most of the routing problem variables are integers such as capacity of the vehicle, time window constraints, and many more. In addition, routing problem constraints can be formulated in the way of linear equations or inequalities. The strategies of branch-and-bound, branch-and-cut, branch-and-price, and branch-and-cut-and-price are among the mostly used strategies in Integer Linear Programming, whereas Constraint Programming is a process of identifying feasible solutions where the problem is modeled in terms of global constraints.},

This type of problem is often encountered in practice and is very challenging due to the interdependency among the vehicle routes, but has received little attention in the literature. A constraint programming-based adaptive large neighborhood search is proposed to solve this problem. The search abilities of the large neighborhood search and the constraint propagation abilities of constraint programming are combined to determine the feasibility of any proposed modification to the current solution.

This problem has applications in many service provider industries where employees visit customers to perform activities. Given their similarity, we adapt a mathematical programming model from the literature on vehicle routing problem with time windows ({VRPTW}) to conduct this computational study on the {WSRP}. We generate a set of {WSRP} instances from a well-known {VRPTW} data set. This work has three objectives. First, to investigate feasibility and optimality on a range of medium size {WSRP} instances with different distribution of visiting locations and including teaming and connected activities constraints. Second, to compare the generated {WSRP} instances to their counterpart {VRPTW} instances with respect to their difficulty. Third, to determine the computation time required by a mathematical programming solver to find feasible solutions for the generated {WSRP} instances. It is observed that although the solver can achieve feasible solutions for some instances, the current solver capabilities are still limited. Another observation is the {WSRP} instances present an increased degree of difficulty because of the additional constraints. The key contribution of this paper is to present some test instances and corresponding benchmark study for the {WSRP}.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates the problem of scheduling and routing employees that are required to perform activities at clients’ locations. Clients request the activities to be performed during a time period. Employees are required to have the skills and qualifications necessary to perform their designated activities. The working time of employees must be respected. Activities could require more than one employee. Additionally, an activity might have time-dependent constraints with other activities. Time-dependent activities constraints include: synchronisation, when two activities need to start at the same time; overlap, if at any time two activities are being performed simultaneously; and with a time difference between the start of the two activities. Such time difference can be given as a minimum time difference, maximum time difference, or a combination of both (min-max). The applicability of such workforce scheduling and routing problem ({WSRP}) is found in many industries e.g. home health care provision, midwives visiting future mothers, technicians performing installations and repairs, estate agents showing residences for sale, security guards patrolling different locations, etc. Such diversity makes the {WSRP} an important combinatorial optimisation problem to study. Five data sets, obtained from the literature, were normalised and used to investigate the problem. A total of 375 instances were derived from these data sets. Two mathematical models, an integer and a mixed integer, are used. The integer model does not consider the case when the number of employees is not enough to perform all activities. The mixed integer model can leave activities unassigned. A mathematical solver is used to obtain feasible solutions for the instances. The solver provides optimal solutions for small instances, but it cannot provide feasible solutions for medium and large instances. This thesis presents the gradual development of a greedy heuristic that is designed to tackle medium and large instances. Five versions of the greedy heuristic are presented, each of them obtains better results than the previous one. All versions are compared to the results obtained by the mathematical solver when using the mixed integer model. The greedy heuristic exploits domain information to speed the search and discard infeasible solutions. It uses tailored functions to deal with each of the time-dependent activity constraints. These constraints make more difficult the solution process. Further improvements are obtained by using tabu search. It provides moves based on the tailored functions of the greedy heuristic. Overall, the greedy heuristic and the tabu search, maintain feasible solutions at all times. The main contributions of this thesis are: the definition of {WSRP}; the introduction of 375 instances based on five data sets; the adaptation of two mathematical models; the introduction of a greedy heuristic capable of obtaining better results than the solver; and, the implementation of a tabu search to further improve the results.},

Vice-versa, decreasing the number of bins can lead to higher-quality solutions but at the expense of reducing choice.

	abstract = {Intelligent {AI} systems using approaches containing emergent elements often encounter acceptance problems. Results do not get sufficiently explained and the procedure itself can not be fully retraced because the flow of control is dependent on stochastic elements. Trust in such algorithms must be established so that users will accept results, without questioning whether the algorithm is sound. In this position paper we present an approach in which the user gets involved in the optimization procedure by letting them chose alternative solutions from a structure-archive which is created by the {MAP}-Elites algorithm. Analysis of these alternatives along the criteria of multiobjective optimization problems makes solutions comprehensible and hence is a means to build trust. We propose that the solution-focused nature of {MAP}-Elites allows the history of a solution to be easily shown to the user, explaining why that solution was included in those presented to the user. Here we demonstrate our ideas using a logistics problem previously explored by the authors.},

	abstract = {Quality-Diversity optimization is a new family of optimization algorithms that, instead of searching for a single optimal solution to solving a task, searches for a large collection of solutions that all solve the task in a different way. This approach is particularly promising for learning behavioral repertoires in robotics, as such a diversity of behaviors enables robots to be more versatile and resilient. However, these algorithms require the user to manually define behavioral descriptors, which is used to determine whether two solutions are different or similar. The choice of a behavioral descriptor is crucial, as it completely changes the solution types that the algorithm derives. In this paper, we introduce a new method to automatically define this descriptor by combining Quality-Diversity algorithms with unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms. This approach enables robots to autonomously discover the range of their capabilities while interacting with their environment. The results from two experimental scenarios demonstrate that robot can autonomously discover a large range of possible behaviors, without any prior knowledge about their morphology and environment. Furthermore, these behaviors are deemed to be similar to hand-crafted solutions that uses domain knowledge and significantly more diverse than when using existing unsupervised methods.},

	doi = {10.1145/3377930.3390232},
	abstract = {We focus on the challenge of finding a diverse collection of quality
solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity ({QD})
algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition ({NSLC}) and {MAP}-Elites are
designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a
large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile,
variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy ({CMA}-{ES}) are
among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective
continuous domains. This paper proposes a new {QD} algorithm called Covariance
Matrix Adaptation {MAP}-Elites ({CMA}-{ME}). Our new algorithm combines the
self-adaptation techniques of {CMA}-{ES} with archiving and mapping techniques for
maintaining diversity in {QD}. Results from experiments based on standard
continuous optimization benchmarks show that {CMA}-{ME} finds better-quality
solutions than {MAP}-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone
show that {CMA}-{ME} finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of
strategies than both {CMA}-{ES} and {MAP}-Elites. Overall, {CMA}-{ME} more than doubles
the performance of {MAP}-Elites using standard {QD} performance metrics. These
results suggest that {QD} algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art
optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously
exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant
applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other
domains.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03902},
	abstract = {In order to fully exploit the advantages inherent to cooperating heterogeneous multi-robot teams, sophisticated coordination algorithms are essential. Time-extended multi-robot task allocation approaches assign and schedule a set of tasks to a group of robots such that certain objectives are optimized and operational constraints are met. This is particularly challenging if cooperative tasks, i.e. tasks that require two or more robots to work directly together, are considered. In this paper, we present an easy-to-implement criterion to validate the feasibility, i.e. executability, of solutions to time-extended multi-robot task allocation problems with cross schedule dependencies arising from the consideration of cooperative tasks and precedence constraints. Using the introduced feasibility criterion, we propose a local improvement heuristic based on a neighborhood operator for the problem class under consideration. The initial solution is obtained by a greedy constructive heuristic. Both methods use a generalized cost structure and are therefore able to handle various objective function instances. We evaluate the proposed approach using test scenarios of different problem sizes, all comprising the complexity aspects of the regarded problem. The simulation results illustrate the improvement potential arising from the application of the local improvement heuristic.},

In this domain a group of fire truck agents attempt to address fires spread throughout a city in the wake of a large-scale disaster. The disaster has also caused many city roads to be blocked by impassable debris, which can be cleared by bulldozer robots. A high-quality coordination solution must determine not only a task allocation but also what routes the fire trucks should take given the intra-path precedence constraints and which bulldozers should be assigned to clear debris along those routes.},

There are several foreseen benefits of {MRS} compared to single robot systems such as the increased ability to resolve task complexity, increasing performance, reliability and simplicity in design. These benefits have attracted many researchers from academia and industry to investigate how to design and develop robust versatile {MRS} by solving a number of challenging problems such as complex task allocation, group formation, cooperative object detection and tracking, communication relaying and self-organization to name just a few. One of the most challenging problems of {MRS} is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known as Multi-robot Task Allocation ({MRTA}) problem. {MRTA} is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements and constraints in an optimal way.

Optimization problem solving is currently addressed within Operational Research ({OR}) through computational algorithms that aim to find the best solution in a problem (e.g. routing problem). Limited investigation there is on how computerized interactivity and metacognitive support (e.g. feedback and planning) can support optimization problem solving. This paper reports on human performance on Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems ({CVRPs}) using paper-based problems and two different versions of an interactive computerized tool (one version with live explanatory and directive feedback alongside planning (strategy) support; one version without strategy support but with live explanatory feedback). Results suggest that human performance did not change when people were given paper-based post-problem feedback. On the contrary, participants' performance improved significantly when they used either version of the interactive tool that facilitated both live feedback support. No differences in performance across the two versions were observed. Implications on current theories and design implications for future optimization systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {We consider a dynamic bi-objective vehicle routing problem, where a subset of customers ask for service over time. Therein, the distance traveled by a single vehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm ({DEMOA}), which operates on discrete time windows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any decision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To understand effects of sequences of decision-making and interactions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of experiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences \$D\$ and the number of eras \$n\_t\$ and analyze all \${\textbar}D{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{n\_t\}\$ combinations of decision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final selected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision history, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited dynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate solutions obtained by a clairvoyant {EMOA}. In contrast, for instances with clustered customers, we observe a strong dependency on decision-making history as well as more variance in solution diversity.},

	abstract = {This article presents a review and a classification of interactive optimization methods. These interactive methods are used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the user’s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.},

	abstract = {Tactical supply-chain planning consists of deciding the amount of products produced, consumed, stored or transported for each period of a given time frame with a precise objective to optimize. Many mathematical models have been proposed but most of the time they do not exploit decision makers intuition and preferences. Mixed-Initiative Systems ({MIS}) aim to solve problems in a different way, coordinating the interaction of intelligent automated agents and humans. {MIS} were developed for discrete combinatorial optimization but recently, a novel {MIS} approach has been proposed for problems showing a linear structure, like tactical supply-chain optimization. This approach allows a decision maker to explore a space of optimal solutions. In this paper, this scheme is improved in order to allow a user to explore near-optimal solutions as well. Furthermore, instead of interacting with bar charts, the decision maker uses the map-based {LogiLab} user interface which allows him to view/modify in real time the flow between businesses of a forest-products supply chain.},

Current off-the-shelf planners can take a very long time before generating a near-optimal solution. In an effort to reduce plan computation time, increase the quality of the resulting plans, and make them more interpretable by humans, we explore collaborative planning techniques that actively involve human users in plan generation. Specifically, we explore a framework in which users provide high-level strategies encoded as soft preferences to guide the low-level search of the planner. Through human subject experimentation, we empirically demonstrate that this approach results in statistically significant improvements to plan quality, without substantially increasing computation time. We also show that the resulting plans achieve greater similarity to those generated by humans with regard to the produced sequences of actions, as compared to plans that do not incorporate user-provided strategies.},

	abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the classical problems in transportation science. Many algorithms have been proposed over the last decades, but the problem is still hard to solve, even for computers. We conduct a laboratory experiment to identify human solution strategies for the vehicle routing problem. Using a newly introduced discrete choice model, we show that humans tend to follow local-to-global problem-solving strategies, which involves a distinction between a first construction and a second improvement phase. When comparing the human performance with the optimal solution and classical heuristics (nearest neighbor, savings, and sweep), we see that participants typically perform better than the worst heuristic and worse than the best heuristic. Also, the combination of clustering and routing in the vehicle routing problem complicates finding good solutions compared to the traveling salesman problem, where particularly poor clustering leads to poor solutions. Especially participants with lower cognitive reflection test scores fail to identify good clusters and tend to use clusters that make the routing problem of a cluster easier. Moreover, only participants with a high cognitive reflection test score were able to improve solutions by using feedback on the current tour length. The other group even disimproved. Lastly, using the feedback option too often leads to a decline in performance which implies an overreaction of corrections made to an existing solution.},

However, before plunging into the mathematical development, it will be helpful to consider some examples of vehicle routing problems and various practical issues that arise in the use of vehicle routing models. Vehicle routing problems are all around us in the sense that many consumer products such as soft drinks, beer, bread, snack foods, gasoline and pharmaceuticals are delivered to retail outlets by fleets of trucks whose operation fits the vehicle routing model. Other examples of vehicle routing problems include the delivery of liquefied industrial gases and the collection of milk from farms for transportation to a processing center. Many companies have reported successful implementation of mathematical algorithms to optimize trucking operations including Air Products and Chemicals, Chevron, {DuPont}, Edward Don and Company etc. Two approaches have been taken to providing geographic information. The first approach is easy to implement and thus preferred if it is accurate enough. It consists of assigning coordinates to each customer and assuming that the travel distance between customers is the Euclidean distance between their coordinate pairs. Cost is taken to be proportional to distance. The distance is often scaled up by a factor to compensate for roads that deviate from a straight-line path between customers. The second approach obtains travel distances by applying a shortest route algorithm to a computerized network model of the road system.},

Theory, practice, and computer hardware and software have come a long way since then, so that today vehicle routing is considered one of the great success stories of operations research. In the last 40 years, there have been hundreds of successful applications in dozen of industries in numerous countries. The successful implementation of vehicle routing software has been aided by the exponential growth in computing power since 1950, the emergence of accurate and sophisticated geographic information systems ({GIS}) technology, and easy-to-use interface software that enables the customer to integrate routing with other key functions such as billing, inventory tracking, and forecasting (see Hall and Partyka [43]).},

In the orienteering problem, a set of vertices is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a path, limited in length, that visits some vertices and maximises the sum of the collected scores. In this paper, the literature about the orienteering problem and its applications is reviewed. The {OP} is formally described and many relevant variants are presented. All published exact solution approaches and (meta) heuristics are discussed and compared. Interesting open research questions concerning the {OP} conclude this paper.},

Two types of neighborhoods, corresponding to the two sets of decisions of the problem, together with a strategy controlling the selection of the neighborhood type for particular phases of the search, provide the means to set up and combine exploration and exploitation capabilities for the search. A diversification strategy, guided by an elite solution set and a frequency-based memory, is also used to drive the search to potentially unexplored good regions and, hopefully, enhance the solution quality. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with the literature show that the proposed tabu search yields very high quality solutions, improving those currently published.},

	abstract = {In general, computer-aided design support systems have got an approach of traditional artificial intelligence, which statistically analyzes data such as the behavior of designer, to extract formal design behavior. This approach, however, can neither deal with continuous change of fashion nor reflect personal taste well, as it just depends on large amount of collected data. To overcome this sort of problem interactive genetic algorithm ({IGA}) has been recently proposed, as a new trend of evolutionary computation. {IGA} uses human's response as fitness value when the fitness function cannot be explicitly defined. This enables {IGA} to be applied to artistic domains, and we propose a fashion design aid system using it. Unlike the previous works that attempt to model the dress design by several spline curves, the proposed system is based on a new encoding scheme that practically describes a dress with three parts: body and neck, sleeve, and skirt. By incorporating the domain-specific knowledge into the genotype, we could develop a more realistic design aid system for women’s dress. We have implemented the system with {OpenGL} and {VRML} to enhance the system interface. The experiments with several human subjects show that the {IGA} approach to dress design aid system is promising.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909},
	abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites ({MAP}-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. {MAP}-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because {MAP}-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because {MAP}- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a unified exact method for solving an extended model of the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem ({CVRP}), called the Heterogenous Vehicle Routing Problem ({HVRP}), where a mixed fleet of vehicles having different capacities, routing and fixed costs is used to supply a set of customers. The {HVRP} model considered in this paper contains as special cases: the Single Depot {CVRP}, all variants of the {HVRP} presented in the literature, the Site-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem ({SDVRP}) and the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem ({MDVRP}). This paper presents an exact algorithm for the {HVRP} based on the set partitioning formulation. The exact algorithm uses three types of bounding procedures based on the {LP}-relaxation and on the Lagrangean relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of {HVRPs}, {SDVRP} and {MDVRP} show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered.},
