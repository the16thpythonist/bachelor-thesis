% MY IDEAS FOR THE COMPUTATIONAL TESTING
%
% - Since what I will be implementing the a more general problem, I would like to verify the algorithm 
% first on Solomons basic time window instances for example, to prove that it can also handle the 
% easier special case with some sort of efficiency
%
% - Then I guess I would take instances from the known literature, that is either
% Mankowska or Bredstr√∂m (if they are available). Because with these I could make a comparison to 
% the objective functions, not with one othe paper but some of them, which have also used these.
%
% - Then I could imagine also creating a random set of instances for sensitivity analysis and also 
% testing of how big of an instance the algorithm can handle at its maximum...
%
% - Then of course I would ask for some representative instances for the actual planetary exploration
% scenario and run those...
