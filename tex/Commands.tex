% COMPARISON TABLES
% =================
% The following commands are to be used in the comparison tables in the second chapter "literature review"

% This command wraps a few other commands, which are commonly used to init the "table" environment. That is for 
% example centering the content and setting row column spacing
\newcommand{\tableConfig}{\centering \setlength{\tabcolsep}{8pt} \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.3} \scriptsize}

% A shorthand for the checkmark symbol, which is faster to write, because it is being used 
% so much in the comparison tables
\newcommand{\yes}{\checkmark}
\newcommand{\nop}{ }
\newcommand{\blank}{ }
\newcommand{\sep}{\arrayrulecolor{black!10}\midrule\arrayrulecolor{black!100}}

% All the following commands are ust wrapping a single symbol to be placed in the summarizing final table of the 
% comparison.
% I decided to use commands instead of the actual symbols for two reasons:
% 1) The names of the commands are more expressive in the code, than just the symbols. Reading the Latex code, one can 
% understand what the symbols stand for.
% 2) If I ever decide to change the symbols at one point or even just tweak them in a little way then I will just have to 
% do it here at this point and not search for all the usages throughout the code.
